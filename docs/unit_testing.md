## Using ContactStore in unit tests (experimental)

The optional `com.alexstyl:contactstore-test` dependency provides a pure Kotlin implementation of `ContactStore`, named `TestContactStore`.

This implementation is meant for unit testing purposes without the need of running the tests on a real Android device or the use of frameworks such as Robolectric.
